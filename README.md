# Directed Distance Function

This repository contains all the code needed to train a network to learn the directed distance to an object surface. This includes code for data generation, model creation, training, and visualization.

## Data Generation / Sampling Rays

The data generation code offers a few methods for sampling rays with the idea that some sampling techniques produce harder to learn rays (edge cases). To visualize the different sampling methods, use

`python sampling.py -v --mesh_file <path to .obj --use_4d>`

You can also see how fast each sampling method is by running

`python sampling.py -s`

## Training

To train, test, and save a network, run

`python train4D.py -Tts -n mynetwork --mesh_file <path to .obj> --save_dir <dir results can be written in> --intersect_limit <# of intersections>`

The flags `-d`, `-v`, `-p`, and `-m` can be used to create depth images, depth video, point clouds, and meshes respectively. The video will be saved to `<save_dir>/depth_videos` while the rest of the visualizations will be displayed on screen.

To see all flags use

`python train4D.py --help`
